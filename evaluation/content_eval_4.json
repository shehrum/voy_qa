  "question": "Information about Mounjaro?",
  "generated_answer": "Mounjaro is a medication designed to aid in weight loss by activating receptors for two hormones, GLP-1 and GIP, which are found in the digestive tract and increase after eating. These hormones help provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period and target receptors in the brain to help lower the body's 'set point' for weight, making it easier to make healthier choices and reduce calorie intake to optimize weight loss.\n\nMounjaro works by reducing appetite, cravings, and the body's set point, which can help users lose more weight before reaching a plateau. It is administered through a once-weekly injection under the skin, in areas such as the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm, with the advice to rotate the injection site each time to minimize discomfort or irritation.\n\nThe medication should be stored in the refrigerator between 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F) and can be kept at room temperature up to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) for up to 30 days if necessary. Once a pen is started, it must be used within 30 days.\n\nMounjaro is available in dosages that start at 2.5mg and can be titrated up to higher doses based on the individual's response and as advised by their healthcare provider. The dosages available are 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg, and 15mg, with specific instructions for titration.\n\nFor more detailed information on how Mounjaro works and guidance on how to take it, including a step-by-step guide, you can visit the official site: Mounjaro.com.\n\nPlease note, this information is based on Voy's official documentation and is intended for educational purposes only.
