  "question": "Information about Wegovy?",
  "generated_answer": "Wegovy is a medication that contains a hormone called GLP-1, which is naturally found in the gut. Its primary function is to regulate appetite and induce a feeling of fullness for an extended period. This helps in reducing cravings and maintaining satisfaction after meals.

It reduces appetite, making you feel less hungry.\n2. It diminishes cravings, making it easier to opt for healthy food choices.\n3.
