  "question": "General Guidance for Missing Doses?",
  "generated_answer": "If you've missed a dose of your Mounjaro or Wegovy treatment, here's what you should do according to Voy's official guidance:\n\n- **Missed 1 Dose:** You have two options. You can take the missed dose as soon as you remember and then continue your injections on this new day moving forward. Alternatively, you can wait until your next scheduled dose and administer it then.\n\n- **Missed More Than 2 Doses:** It's important to contact Voy's clinical team for advice. A dose adjustment to a lower strength may be necessary for your safety.\n\n**Want to Change Your Injection Day?** Ensure at least 4 days have passed since your last injection before administering the next dose. This may require extending the gap between doses to more than the usual 7 days to adjust your schedule.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- Once you've started using a pen, it must be used within 30 days of the first dose.\n- Do not use the medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless (slightly yellow).\n- Dispose of used needles and finished pens in the sharps bin provided.
