This might mean extending the gap between doses longer than the usual 7 days to shift your schedule.\n\n\n\n\nFor personalized guidance or if you have any concerns, you can contact our clinical team directly through your account or book a call with them here: Book a Call with Clinicians."

    "title": "Information about Wegovy",
    "content": "We understand this is an initial step in your weight loss journey towards healthy living, and we’re here for every bump in the road. Just let us know if you have any worries, feedback or questions.\nAs a first step, it’s important for you to take the time to read the manufacturer’s patient information leaflet enclosed in your box. This gives you everything you need to know about how to take the medication, what to avoid, side effects and potential interactions with other medications.\n \nWhat is Wegovy\nWegovy contains a hormone called GLP-1 that occurs naturally in the gut. Its purpose is to regulate appetite and provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period, helping to reduce cravings and keep you satisfied after meals. By targeting the receptors responsible for appetite in the brain, this medication helps to lower the body's natural ‘set point’, which is the weight it strives to maintain. Since Wegovy reduces your appetite, it gives you the opportunity to make healthier choices and reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss.\nHow does Wegovy work? \nIn a nutshell\n1. Reduces appetite—so you are less hungry\n2. Reduces cravings—so it’s easier to make healthy choices\n3. Reduces your set point—so you can lose more weight before starting to plateau\n \nWegovy Titrations\nWegovy is available in 5 different dose strengths – 0.25mg, 0.5mg, 1mg, 1.7mg &amp; 2.4mg. You start Wegovy at a dose of 0.25 mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks until you reach 1mg. It is essential that your starting dose is 0.25mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment.\nIf you'd like to, you can also increase to 1.7mg and 2.4mg for enhanced appetite suppression but this is optional. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience.\n \nHow to take Wegovy?\nYou need to inject Wegovy once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin. It should be injected in the abdomen (keep 5cm away from your belly button), upper legs or upper arms. We advise you to mix up your injection sites each week to minimise discomfort.\nWatch our video about how to take Wegovy before you start your treatment: How to take Wegovy\n \nHow to store Wegovy\nYou can keep the pen for 6 weeks when stored at a temperature below 30°C or in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze your medication and keep it away from the freezer compartment.\nWhen you are not using the pen, keep the pen cap on in order to protect it from light.\nPlease do not use your medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless.\nYou should start using your treatment within 7 days of receiving it and finish using it within 6 weeks from the date on the Voy pharmacy label applied to your medication.\nOnce you’ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you’re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment.\nThese instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box which you’ll receive within your order. "

    "url": "https://joinvoy.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/32242827773716-Information-about-Mounjaro",
    "title": "Information about Mounjaro",
    "content": "What is Mounjaro \nMounjaro is a new medication that activates the receptors of two hormones found in the digestive tract known as GLP-1 and GIP which increase after we eat. They combine to provide a feeling of fullness for an extended period. By also targeting receptors in the brain it helps to lower the ‘set point’ which is the weight it ordinarily strives to maintain. Mounjaro gives you the opportunity and makes it easier to opt for healthier choices to reduce your calorie intake to optimise your weight loss.\nIf you would like to know even more about how Mounjaro works you can learn more from the following site: Mounjaro.com.\n \nHow does Mounjaro work?\nIn a nutshell:\n\nReduces appetite – so you are less hungry\nReduces cravings – so it’s easier to make healthy choices\nReduces your set point – so you can lose more weight before reaching a plateau\n\n \nMounjaro Titrations\nMounjaro comes in six different dose strengths: 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, 10mg, 12.5mg and 15mg. You’ll start Mounjaro at a dose of 2.5mg once a week and increase the dose every 4 weeks, automatically, until you reach the full dose of 15mg by month 6. The dose is gradually increased to allow your body to get used to the medication and minimise any side effects you might experience. Unless otherwise agreed with a clinician, it is essential that your starting dose is 2.5mg - if you have received any other strength, please get in touch with our customer support team before starting your treatment.If you do not want to increase your dose every 4 weeks, please speak to our Medical Team or Customer Care Team, and we'll update your subscription. \n \nWhy is there excess liquid after my fourth dose?\nEvery Mounjaro Kwikpen comes with four doses of medication and enough liquid to prime your pen before every dose. This means that you will see an excess of liquid in your pen after you’ve taken your four doses. This is to be expected and should not be something to worry about. \nPlease do not attempt to take more than 4 doses of your medication, attempting to use your pen more than four times will lock your pen and you’ll no longer be able to access the liquid. \n \nWhere can I find the expiry date for my Mounjaro pen?\nYou can find the expiry date of your medication on the side of your medication box. This will be shown as ‘EXP: DATE’. The expiry date refers to the end of the month that is noted. \n \nHow do I take Mounjaro? \nMounjaro is injected once a week (on the same day each week), under the skin, in the subcutaneous fat. It should be injected in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm (it’s advisable to rotate to a slightly different part of your body each time you inject, this minimises potential discomfort/irritation).\nPlease note that the medication is contained within the clear chamber in the pen, not the individual needles – these are used to deliver each dose.\n \nWatch our step-by-step guide on how to take your Mounjaro before you start your treatment: How to take Mounjaro\n \nHow to store your Mounjaro \nYou should store Mounjaro in the refrigerator between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). If needed, each pen can be stored at room temperature up to 30°C ( 86°F) for up to 30 days.\nOnce you've started the pen, it must be used within 30 days of the first dose.\nThese instructions are supplementary to the information provided in the patient information leaflet in your medication box provided with each order. \nDo not use this medicine if the solution is not clear and colourless or almost colourless (slightly yellow).\nOnce you’ve used your needles and finished your pen, you can dispose of it in the sharps bin provided. Do not throw away any medicines via wastewater or household waste. If you’re unable to use your sharps bin, ask your pharmacist how to throw away medicines you no longer use. These measures will help protect the environment."
